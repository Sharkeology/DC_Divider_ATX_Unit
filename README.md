# DC Divider Project - ATX Base Unit

The ATX Base Unit is part of the larger DC Divider project meant for powering various 12, 9 and 5 volt powered devices (namely games consoles and A/V equipment) from a single ATX power supply unit. The Base Unit was made with the intention of being simple to assemble by beginners and uses off-the-shelf parts and modules.

## Bill of Materials

1 x ATX Base Unit PCB
1 x Right Angle ATX connector (Molex MiniFit Jr) - PRT-09498
1 x LM2596 Adjustable Buck Converter Module
3 x Phoenix MSTB-style 2-pin connectors (5.08mm pin spacing)

Once assembled and connected to an ATX supply, the LM2596 module's output voltage can be adjusted to the users needs (although the project was made with 9 volts in mind).
